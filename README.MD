# Not Pizza
Have you ever seen something and wondered if it was a pizza or not?

No? Doesn't matter. 

What matters is that we have  _state of the art_ image classification system right here that could assist all the people out there in determining if something is a pizza or not.

## Usage
Using it is so simple, all you have to do is head over to https://keidyz.github.io/not-pizza-app/ and upload a photo!

Here, let's try this royalty free photo of a pepperoni pizza I got from [here](https://unsplash.com/photos/_P76trHTWDE)

Great, huh?

Now how about this other [image](https://unsplash.com/photos/UxRhrU8fPHQ)

Now for the final test, let's use [this](https://unsplash.com/photos/MR329Bd-7sA)

Brilliant, isn't it?

## Local usage
- clone the repository: `git@github.com:keidyz/not-pizza-app.git` (or download it to your local)
- once in the folder, install the dependencies: `npm i`
- run it: `npm run dev`

## Inspiration and other notes
This idea came from a clip I saw when I was a kid

The app uses ReactJs and relies on TensorFlow for the bulk of the image classification part of it.

There's already a not hotdog app out there so I made a not pizza app that people can use in conjunction with that.
